## Quick Install

> If you've forked this repo then <your-username> and <repo-name> will be based to your username and repo name. If clonning directly from this repo then <your-username> should be jmziya and <repo-name> should be ethical-hacking-macos-tbt

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>/main/setup_hacker_lab.sh | bash


Replace `<your-username>` and `<repo-name>` with your actual GitHub handle and repo name if forked to your own environment.
